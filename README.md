This repository holds my answers to the course projects from my Data Structures course.


## Introduction to Project 1

In this project I was to provide a tool for visualizing popularity of New York City street trees in different boroughs of the city. My program uses the 2015 Street Tree Census data provided by Department of Parks and Recreation: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/2015-Street-Tree-Census-Tree-Data/uvpi-gqnh
Using this data and a name of the tree specified by the user, my program generates information about popularity of this type of tree in each borough of New York City.


## Introduction to Project 2

In this project I worked on a program that produces all possible words given a collection of letters and a dictionary. The program produces all anagrams of a given set of letters that are valid words in the provided dictionary. For example, if the letters are "recounts" my program prints, in alphabetical order and one per line, all different words that can be made out of those letters (assuming that they are present in the dictionary that the program uses):
  construe
  counters
  recounts
The printed words do not contain any repeats.
The program that I wrote is command line based (no graphical interface). The dictionary is from a file provided as a command line argument and it prompts the user for a set of letters. The output is printed to the terminal. Once the anagrams are displayed, the program terminates.


## Introduction to Project 3

In this assignment I worked on the program that performs image segmentation using region growing algorithms.


## Introduction to Project 4

In this project I got a chance to revisit my code for project 1. Once again, I provided a tool for visualizing popularity of New York City street trees in different boroughs of the city. Using the same data as before and a name of the tree specified by the user, my program generates information about popularity of this type of tree in each borough of New York City.


## Introduction to Project 5

In this project I evaluated the performance of different sort algorithms. The source code was given to me and I only needed to make slight modification to the code. My main task was to collect data and prepare a written report about my findings.
